Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster. \n A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. \n Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. \"user:password@\" is not allowed.
